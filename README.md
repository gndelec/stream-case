## Other hardware required

- STREAM board
- LMS7002EVB board
- Myriad-RF module

## Assembly

![Parts laid out](/images/01-layOut.jpg)

- Lay out all of the parts and ensure you have everything listed in the B.O.M.

![Peel off acrylic backing](/images/02-peel.jpg)

- Remove the protective backing from the acrylic parts. Note that this is likely to generate static electricity - be aware of this and careful not to do this near any electronic hardware that may be sensitive to static electricity. Wipe any clouding / marks from acrylic that may have occured during manufacture.

![Standoff Remove](/images/03-standoffRemove.jpg)

- Remove 4 x M3 x 4mm standoffs from STREAM board

![StandoffReplace](/images/04-standoffReplace.jpg)

- Add 4 x M3 x 12mm screws + 4 x M3 x 5mm standoffs to replace the previous standoffs. Note M3 screws go through bottom of board, all the way through standoffs as shown in photo.

![Standoffs](/images/05-15mmStandoffs.jpg)

- Add 4 x M3 x 15mm M-F standoffs + 4 x M3 x 8mm screws to base.

![Standoffs](/images/06-15mmStandoffs2pt5.jpg)

- Add 2 x M2.5 x 15mm F-F standoffs + 2 x M2.5 x 6mm screws to base.

![Standoffs](/images/07-25mmStandoffs.jpg)

- Add 4 x M3 x 25mm M-F standoffs + 4 x M3 X 8mm screws to base.

![Standoffs](/images/08-40mmStandoffs.jpg)

- Add 6 x M3 x 40mm standoffs + 6 x M3 hex nuts (Note these to be mounted opposite way up to other standoffs - male thread through base)

![STREAM](/images/09-stream.jpg)

- Place STREAM board onto 15mm standoffs.

![nuts](/images/10-nuts.jpg)

- Add 4 x M3 hex nuts to hold STREAM board in place. Note to be careful not to overtighten.

![screws](/images/11-m2pt5screws.jpg)

- Add 2 x M2.5 x 6mm screws through STREAM board, either side of the J21 connector.

STEPS BELOW ARE OPTIONAL: depending on extra boards to be used. Photos show both boards connected for convenience of viewing but this setup has not been tested: it is expected either one or the other will be used.

![washers](/images/12-m3washers.jpg)

- Add M3 washers to 4 x M3 x 25mm standoffs to get correct height for LMS7002EVB board (we found 2 or 3 per standoff to work well depending on the washers used).

![LMS7002EVB](/images/13-lmsBoard.jpg)

- Add LMS7002EVB to M3 x 25mm standoffs + washers.

![nuts](/images/14-nuts.jpg)

- Add 4 x M3 hex nuts to hold LMS7002EVB in place. Again noting care to not overtighten.

![MyriadRF](/images/15-MyriadRF.jpg)

- Add Myriad-RF module to STREAM board (Note that extra care should be taken due to the delicate nature of the connectors used)

![nuts](/images/16-nuts.jpg)

- Add 3 x M3 hex nuts to hold Myriad-RF module in place (note that one corner does not allow for an M3 hex nut due insufficient clearance of nearby header)

![sides](/images/17-sides.jpg)

- Add 2 x side pieces and optional breakout connectors / wire assemblies as needed (not included in kit)

![top](/images/18-top.jpg)

- Add top plate to assembly

- Add 6 x M3 x 8mm screws to secure top plate in place.

![feet](/images/19-feet.jpg)

- Turn the assembly over and stick the 6 x self adhesive rubber bumpers to the base.

##Notes

- The MRFC-01 case includes PEEK+ array (15mm) compatible hole spacing for easy addition of modules and hardware should you wish to exapnd your system. Note that we used 3mm holes to allow for use of M3 hardware and avoid the need for extra threaded push-fit parts.

- The MRFC-01 kit contains some extra units of the smaller hardware such as nuts and washers - do not be alarmed if there are some left over after completion of assembly!
