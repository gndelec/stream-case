## Other hardware required



## Assembly

![Parts laid out]()

- Lay out all of the parts and ensure you have everything listed in the B.O.M.

- Remove the protective backing from the acrylic parts. Note that this is likely to generate static electricity - be aware of this and careful not to do this near any electronic hardware that may be sensitive to static electricity. Wipe any clouding / marks from acrylic that may have occured during manufacture.


- Turn the assembly over and stick the 4 x self adhesive rubber bumpers to the base.

##Notes

- Note that if disassembly is required, or the top panel is removed it should be noted that removal of the fan power connector is advised.

- Similarly is is advised that caution is taken when disassembling to the point of hard drive removal - care must be taken to remove the drive along with mounting screws in such a fashion as to not apply unwanted force on the hard drive connector.

- The MRFC-01 case includes PEEK+ array (15mm) compatible hole spacing for easy addition of modules and hardware should you wish to exapnd your system. Note that we used 3mm holes to allow for use of M3 hardware and avoid the need for extra threaded push-fit parts.
